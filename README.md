# X-ray_enhancer

# Description

It is a simple OpenCV project. Its GUI is done using Tkinter and uses Python as core programming language. <br /><br />
In case of X-ray enhancer, I have used Gaussian Blur to remove noise, Laplacian filter for smoothing, sobel filter for edge detection and adding of images to add different image results.<br /><br />
